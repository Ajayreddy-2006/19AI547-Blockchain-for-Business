# Experiment 2: Blockchain-Based Crowdfunding (Kickstarter Alternative)
## Aim:
To create a decentralized crowdfunding platform where donors contribute funds only if the campaign goal is met.

## Algorithm:
step 1.Project owner deploys the contract by specifying a funding goal and deadline.

step 2.Contributors send ETH to the contract before the deadline.

step 3.The contract tracks each contributor’s amount.

step 4.If the total contributions meet or exceed the goal before the deadline:

step 5.The creator can withdraw the full amount.

step .If the goal is not met after the deadline:

step 7.Contributors can withdraw their individual contributions.

        campaign.amountRaised += msg.value;

    function withdrawFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == campaign.creator, "Only creator can withdraw");
        require(campaign.amountRaised >= campaign.goal, "Goal not met");
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(campaign.amountRaised);
        campaign.goalMet = true;
    }

    function refund() public {
        require(block.timestamp > campaign.deadline, "Campaign still active");
        require(campaign.amountRaised < campaign.goal, "Goal was met");
        uint256 amount = campaign.contributions[msg.sender];
        campaign.contributions[msg.sender] = 0;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
}
```
# Expected Output:
Users can contribute ETH to the campaign.

# High-Level Overview:
Teaches decentralized fundraising.


Avoids fraud by ensuring funds are only transferred if the goal is met.

# RESULT: 
Hence we implemented Blockchain-Based Crowdfunding (Kickstarter Alternative)
